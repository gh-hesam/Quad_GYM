# Quad_GYM
implementation of quadrotor attitude simulation in GYM like environment

This is a three-degree-of-freedom simulation of quadrotor attitude motion. In this simulation, an API according to GYM's API is also developed in order to provide the possibility of testing reinforcement learning algorithms to control the attitude of the quadrotor. The reward function is also configurable in the script.
In this simulation, two conventional configurations for quad rotors are also considered, which are known as X and + configurations.
Also, a PID controller has been developed to control the state of the robot.
